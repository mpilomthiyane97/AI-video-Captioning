# Overview
In the previous project, you processed a video by dividing it into multiple frames, then passing them into a model to generate descriptions. Now, we're going to build on that by incorporating text summarization using the Google T5 model.

# Models
You will use the following models:
- **Salesforce/blip-image-captioning-base**: A pre-trained model for generating captions for images, which can be found [here](https://huggingface.co/Salesforce/blip-image-captioning-base).
- **Google/T5**: A pre-trained text-to-text transformer model that is excellent for summarization tasks. It can be found [here](https://huggingface.co/google/t5-v1_1-base).
- **Microsoft/SpeechT5**: A pre-trained model designed for text-to-speech tasks. This model will be used to convert the summarized text into audio. It can be found [here](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/speecht5_tts).

# Instructions
Your code should be capable of doing the following:

1. **Accept a video file**: You will start by accepting a video file as input.
  
2. **Process the video**: Divide the video into multiple frames, just as you did in your previous project.
  
3. **Generate descriptions**: Pass these frames into the BLIP model to generate descriptions for each frame.
  
4. **Summarize the descriptions**: Instead of simply displaying all the descriptions, you will now pass them through the Google T5 model to generate a summarized description of the entire video content.
  
5. **Convert to speech**: Use the Microsoft SpeechT5 model to convert the summarized text into speech.

6. **Output the summary and audio**: Display the summarized description in text format through Gradio and provide an option to play the generated audio.


# Expected Outcome
By the end of this assignment, you should have a working script that takes a video, generates a summarized description using the power of Google T5, and converts that summary into audio using Microsoft SpeechT5. This project will combine your skills in video processing, image captioning, text summarization, and speech synthesis.
